# How the map exploration works:
# Try walkign forward. If there is a wall, turn right. If there isn't,
# walk forward and turn left. Only works if the maze has no loops.
# If the droid reaches the origin again then all paths have been explored.
# Works only if the origin is in a dead end, otherwise I would need more
# conditions to detect this?
